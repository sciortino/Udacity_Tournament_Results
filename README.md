# Udacity_Tournament_Results
My submission for the Tournament Results project, part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree

To run:
1. Install PostgreSQL in your environment.
2. Create a database called "tournament".
3. Run the script "tournament.sql" through psql to create the required table and view schema.
4. You may now call the functions in "tournament.py"

Optional: Run "tournament_test.py" to test out that the database and the python functions are working as intented.
